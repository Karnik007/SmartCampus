# 🚀 SmartCampusAI

An AI-powered real-time location-based recommendation system built with Django.

SmartCampusAI provides dynamic nearby recommendations including:

* 🍽 Restaurants & Cafes
* 🛍 Markets & Shops
* 🎮 Game Zones & Leisure Spots
* 🌳 Parks
* 🎉 Live Events

The system integrates multiple real-world APIs and applies intelligent ranking to deliver personalized recommendations.

## 🌍 Live Location-Based Recommendations

The engine uses:

* 🟢 OpenStreetMap (Overpass API) – Base venue data
* 🟢 Foursquare Places API – Enriched place details
* 🟢 Eventbrite API – Real-time nearby events

User GPS coordinates are captured via browser geolocation and sent securely to the backend.

---

## 🧠 Intelligent Scoring System

Each recommendation is ranked using a custom AI scoring algorithm:

```
score =
+3 if matches user preference
+2 if rating > 4
- (distance / 500)
+1 if open now
+2 if popular
```

Results are sorted by score and top recommendations are returned.
